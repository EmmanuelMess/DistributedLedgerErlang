# DistributedLedgerErlang
A distributer ledger with ISIS algo for total ordering of messages

## Description
This has an `ledger:append` (with `{ Uid, self(), "Message" }`) that adds to the ledger and a `ledger:get` that returns the ledger. 

One ledger per node and one node per ledger (no pure-client nodes). First connect everything and then start with `ledger:start()` at each node, you can stop the ledger with `ledger:stop()`.

This implementation fails after more than n/2 nodes fail.
